# Empathy AI Community Guardian

![Empathy AI — Story demo](./assets/empathy_demo.gif)

Empathy AI Community Guardian is an AI-powered social-impact project built at HackFest 2025 to empower communities with safety, support, and empathy.

---

Watch the quick demo above — it walks through the project story:

1) Empathetic AI understands feelings.  
2) Sentiment & emotion detection from chat/text.  
3) Real-time alerts to community groups.  
4) Anonymous reporting & group support.  
5) Resource recommendations and emergency assistance.  
6) Admin dashboard for organizers.

Demo assets (added to the repo):
- GIF (looping preview): ./assets/empathy_demo.gif
- MP4 (high quality, voiceover + captions): ./assets/empathy_demo.mp4
- Lottie (vector animation for web): ./assets/empathy_demo.lottie.json
- Story SVG (editable): ./assets/hero_story.svg

How it works:
- The GIF shows a short 12–15s storytelling animation that appears line-by-line like a short video.  
- The MP4 contains the same animation plus an optional voiceover (English + Hindi options included).  
- The Lottie JSON is for embedding the same animation in your website for crisp vector motion.

Quick usage:
- To use the GIF in the README (already embedded above) just keep it in ./assets and GitHub will show it.
- For your React site, import the Lottie or use the included React component (src/components/AnimatedHeroStory.jsx).

Notes:
- If you want me to commit these assets to the animated-readme branch and generate the GIF/MP4/Lottie files for you, reply "Push and generate" and I will push and create the media files (GIF, MP4 w/ voiceover, Lottie).
- If you prefer I only push the files and you generate media locally, reply "Push only" and I will commit everything except generated GIF/MP4/Lottie.
